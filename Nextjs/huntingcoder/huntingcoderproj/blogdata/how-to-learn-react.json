    "content":"Another way to learn JavaScript fast is to practice actively. Practicing actively means you spend more time writing code than just watching or reading tutorials.  Real learning happens when you move your hands and feet in activities like playing football or driving a car. Like these activities, you learn faster when you write JavaScript code on the computer.  Try to write code for at least 30 minutes or one hour a day. By writing code regularly and practicing what you've learned, you will improve your JavaScript knowledge more quickly.  Don't forget to take breaks on the weekends. Resting is also a crucial part of learning JavaScript. You can learn JavaScript efficiently when you are well-rested, and it helps to improve your sense of focus"
